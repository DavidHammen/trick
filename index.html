        <h3>What is Trick</h3>
          <p>Trick is a generic simulation toolkit.
          </p>
          <p>A Trick simulation is a run-time executive designed for both real-time and non-real-time
             applications having both time-based and event-based scheduling requirements, including
             hardware-in-the-loop, human-in-the-loop, multi-processor and multi-box applications.
          </p>
          <p>Trick simulations are designed to be data driven wherever possible. The run-time
             executive provides a simple interface that allows the user to configure model parameters,
             integration schemes, and real-time controls for each application.
          </p>
          <p>Trick takes the burden off the modeler to create simulation executive ware. Trick does
             this by fusing its own simulation executive with the developer's models. Trick takes the
             responsibility of creating all source code for run-time input, data recording output and
             data communication between model components. The developer's responsibility is reduced to
             building a simulation definition file and the model code. This plug-in approach coupled
             with multi-platform and multi-programming support allows modeling groups to create reusable,
             shared and versatile models across distributed locations.
